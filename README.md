# Smart-Mirror

The mirror looks like normal mirror but as soon as we start operating it it turns into a full fledged digital screen with built in Google Assistant to support it via audio commands also. The mirror provides a functional, user friendly and interactive UI to its user for accessing their social sites, messengers, etc...
The intention of making it is to integrate all these technologies to implement a low-cost, easy-to-use wireless domotic system along with the real-time monitoring system to improve the Quality of Life.
